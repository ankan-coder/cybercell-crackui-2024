# cybercell-ui
Web UI designed for an event of college club called cybercell.

This webpage, created for a Cybercell event hosted by our college club, is part of a competition where participants were tasked with designing similar pages. While it's not entirely unique, it showcases my interpretation of the challenge amidst a sea of creative submissions.
